# Subtherapeutic-selection-of-Haemonchus-contortus-with-ivermectin-and-moxidectin

Contains code for the following paper looking at a nematode parasite of small ruminants using subtherapeutic selection with ivermectin or moxidectin of a sensitive isolate. We found that we could rapidly select for resistance, but that strength of selection was different between the two macrocyclic lactones.
